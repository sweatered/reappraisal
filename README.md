# Reappraisal study

### This study is being carried out by Phoebe Cooper at The Open University and is investigating whether personality traits and/or cognitive emotional regulation techniques might affect how we perform motor tasks.

The experiment should take about 15 minutes to complete, and will involve a 30 question survey, followed by 10 practice levels of a mouse click task. You will then be given instructions on a cognitive reappraisal technique (emotional regulation) to use in the final 20 levels of the task, which you will then go on to complete.

Please note: You will need a computer mouse for this experiment.
